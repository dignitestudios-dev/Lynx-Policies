      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">

      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx cannot and does not guarantee the identity, intentions, or behavior

        for any injuries, losses, or consequences arising from real-life
        interactions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        6.2. Limitation of Verification
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        University email verification confirms only that a user has access to a
        specific academic email address. It is not a background check. It does
        not verify criminal history, personal character, or the safety of the
        individual. Users are responsible for their own due diligence.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        6.3. Emergency Protocol
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx is not an emergency, security, or medical service. In the event of
        an immediate threat or emergency, users must contact 911, local
        authorities, or campus police directly. Lynx does not provide real-time
        monitoring or emergency response.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        6.4. Absolute Account Control
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx reserves the absolute right to remove any content, restrict
        features, or suspend accounts at any time, for any reason, without prior
        notice or explanation. This authority is exercised to protect the
        platform’s integrity and user community.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        7. Moderation, Accountability & University Cooperation
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx operates on a model of user accountability. By using this platform,
        you acknowledge that your actions are tied to your university identity
        and carry real-world consequences.
      </p>

        7.1. Non-Moderation Statement
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx does not pre-screen or pre-moderate user-generated content. Users
        assume all risk of encountering inaccurate, offensive, or inappropriate
        material. Lynx is not responsible for content posted by users but
        provides reporting tools for community self-regulation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        7.2. University-Linked Accountability
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Because all accounts are verified via university email, your identity is
        known. Lynx reserves the right to report serious misconduct—including
        harassment, threats, or violations of campus policy—directly to
        university administration and law enforcement. Lynx will fully cooperate
        with all official investigations and legal inquiries.
      </p>

        8.3. Identity Verification
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        While email verification confirms access, users are responsible for the
        integrity of their profile data. Lynx is not liable for damages caused
        by users who provide false personal information despite these mandates.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        9. Privacy Mandates & Protection of Personal Data
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx enforces a strict policy regarding user privacy. Any attempt to
        exploit, bypass, or violate the personal boundaries of another user is a
        breach of these Terms of Service.

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        9.1. Mandatory Respect of Privacy Settings
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Every user is granted the right to control their visibility and
        information. Privacy settings are non-negotiable and must be respected
        at all times; any technical or social attempt to bypass, manipulate, or

      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Profile information and discovery features are provided for connection,
        not surveillance. The use of platform data for stalking, obsessive
        monitoring, or the unwanted observation of specific individuals is a
        direct violation and will be treated as harassment.

        Every user maintains the right to control their own data. Visibility on
        leaderboards is optional, and users may opt out through their profile
        settings at any time. Lynx is not responsible for the social
        consequences of a user’s public ranking if they have chosen to remain
        visible.

        20.3. Enforcement of Healthy Competition
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx reserves the absolute right to monitor leaderboard activity and
        impose temporary or permanent restrictions on any user who engages in
        toxic competition, data manipulation, or the harassment of other
        top-ranked individuals.

        20.4. System Integrity
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Any attempt to artificially inflate or deflate a ranking through
        "botting," group-targeting, or coordinated manipulation is a breach of
        platform integrity. Lynx reserves the right to reset or adjust
        leaderboard data to maintain a fair and safe environment.

        21. Mandatory Data Responsibility & Account Security
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        The security of a user account is the sole and absolute responsibility
        of the account holder. Lynx provides the platform, but the user is the
        primary guardian of their own access credentials.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        21.1. Prohibition of Credential Sharing
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Users are strictly prohibited from sharing, selling, or transferring
        their login credentials or account access to any third party. Any
        activity occurring under an account is legally attributed to the
        registered user. Lynx is not liable for any unauthorized access or
        damages resulting from a user’s failure to secure their account.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        21.2. Immediate Reporting Requirement
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Users are mandated to report any suspicious or unauthorized activity to
        Lynx administration immediately. Delay in reporting unauthorized access
        may limit Lynx’s ability to secure the data and may result in the
        account holder being held liable for any misconduct performed under
        their identity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        21.3. Absolute Accountability
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Every user is held strictly accountable for all actions, content, and
        communications transmitted via their account. Lynx assumes no
        responsibility for misuse of an account but reserves the right to
        terminate access if security protocols are breached or ignored.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        22. Enforcement Protocols & Community Protection
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx reserves the absolute authority to enforce these Community
        Standards to preserve the integrity and safety of the university
        environment.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        22.1. Discretionary Sanctions
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx reserves the right to determine the appropriate disciplinary action
        for any violation. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, formal
        warnings, temporary feature restrictions, account suspension, or
        permanent removal.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        22.2. Zero-Tolerance for Recidivism
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Repeated violations or single instances of severe misconduct (such as
        threats of violence or sexual harassment) will lead to immediate and
        permanent bans. Lynx is not required to provide prior notice or a "grace
        period" before terminating an account that threatens community safety.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        22.3. Finality of Enforcement Decisions
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        All enforcement decisions are made in the interest of the broader
        community and are final. Lynx is not liable for any perceived social or
        professional loss resulting from the suspension or removal of a user
        found in violation of these standards.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        23. Regulatory Standards for Endorsements & Public Feedback
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Public feedback tools are proprietary features meant to foster trust.
        The weaponization of reviews for defamation or personal gain is a
        violation of platform integrity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        23.1. Requirement of Truthful, Firsthand Experience
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Endorsements and reviews must be based exclusively on genuine, firsthand
        interactions. Users are prohibited from submitting feedback for events
        they did not attend or services they did not receive.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        23.2. Prohibition of Deceptive Feedback
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        False, retaliatory, or incentivized endorsements (reviews given in
        exchange for payment or favors) are strictly prohibited. Any attempt to
        artificially manipulate a user's reputation will result in the removal
        of all feedback privileges.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        23.3. Zero-Tolerance for Defamatory Content
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Harassing, defamatory, or abusive reviews intended to damage a user's
        standing within the university are not permitted. Lynx reserves the
        right to remove any endorsement that violates platform standards at its
        sole discretion.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        23.4. Non-Liability for Feedback
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Lynx is not responsible for the opinions expressed by users through the
        endorsement system. While Lynx may remove content that violates these
        rules, it is not obligated to mediate disagreements regarding the
        "fairness" of a negative review.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        24. Financial Accountability for In-App Wallet Usage
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        The In-App Wallet is a regulated financial feature. Misuse of the wallet
        for activities outside of legitimate platform transactions is strictly
        prohibited and may be referred to law enforcement.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        24.1. Limitation of Financial Scope
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Wallet payments must relate strictly to legitimate services or events
        hosted within the Lynx ecosystem. Using the wallet for money laundering,
        unauthorized transfers, or the purchase of illegal items will result in
        immediate permanent removal.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        24.2. Fraud and Chargeback Abuse
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Engaging in fraudulent activity, including chargeback abuse (falsely
        claiming a transaction was unauthorized) or payment system manipulation,
        is a severe violation. Lynx will escalate such incidents to university
        financial offices and legal authorities.
      </p>

      <h3 className="ml-4 text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-black">
        24.3. Absolute Transaction Responsibility
      </h3>
      <p className="ml-4 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
        Users are solely responsible for every transaction initiated from their
        account. Lynx is not liable for accidental payments, buyer's remorse, or
        transactions made due to user negligence. Users must verify all
        recipient details and amounts before authorizing any transfer from their
        In-App Wallet.
